						<h1>Our Story</h1>
						<p>Growing up, my father was a carpenter.</p>
					</header>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/woodshop.jpg" alt="Image of a Wood working shop with the word DAD on the workbench drawer." />
					</div>
					<p>And his father (my grandfather) taught shop class at a local college when he was growing up.  And his grandfather (my great grand father) owned a hardware store in Riverhead, LI called: Luce Hardware.  </p>
					<p> My dad was always tinkering with things, building boats and furniture in the garage.  The house always smelled like fresh cut wood.  Well into college, I wanted my father to take me to work with him.  I would tell everyone that he could build anything. </p>
					<p>When I went away to RISD and studied fashion, I came home babbling away to my dad about pockets.  I was fascinated I was with pockets and the history of them.  I was frustrated by how small the pockets were on my own clothes and how many garments I had without pockets.  I was rambling on one day and my dad got up and walked out of the room.  He came back holding a pair of work pants that he loved.  They were covered in pockets.  He went on to describe each one to me in detail and what that pocket was useful for carrying.  I had no idea he cared this much about his clothes. Nor that he cared about the pockets.</p>
					<h2 style="text-align: center">I always wanted to wear these utilitarian garments,<br> but they were built for men.</h2>
					<p> The canvas work shirts, and work pants with hammer slings.  But when I would put them on, I always hated the fit.  The fit was always built for a man's body, not a woman's body.</p>
